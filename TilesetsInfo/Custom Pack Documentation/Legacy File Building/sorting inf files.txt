Each map has a .inf file which points to which tileset is used for the map. This can't be edited in Notepad and required a hex editor. This contains a single byte corresponding to the texture file (tmapaXXX.dat) in keeperfx_0_X_X\data. Once your textures are added with the others to keeperfx_0_X_X\data, edit the byte to correspond the hex value for that pack, e.g. 00 for tmapa000 (it's in hexadecimal, i.e. pack 10 is 0A, 11 is 0B and so on to 15 as 0F, then 16 as 10). rename this .inf to match the rest of the files for the map and voila!
