Download the source code and extract and place it somewhere relevant:

Source code download here: https://github.com/dkfans/keeperfx/archive/master.zip
And graphics here: https://lubiki.keeperklan.com/releases_big/gfx_sources_v11.7z

Type cd "/mnt/d/source/keeperfx"
if you have the source code downloaded to d:\source\keeperfx

cd "/mnt/c/users/[name]/desktop/keeperfx-master"

cd "/mnt/d/Files/Backup 2021 Desktop/Dungeon Keeper Stuff/Source Code and Graphics/keeperfx-master (full to compile)"


make pkg-enginegfx

it will try to download the graphics, it might work, it might not. It should create a folder in the directory you chose called gfx and within that, the same file structure as gfx_sources_v11. if it did not work, make sure you have installed the above lines, especially p7zip-full.

Put your new graphics set in gfx\textures-32, in a folder called e.g pack008. Make/copy a file fo this called filelist_tmapa008.txt, open it and rename rename textures_pack_XXX to textures_pack_008 and all packXXX to pack008 (Ctrl+H for Find and Replace would be quickest).

Now go to pkg_gfx.mk
under "ENGINEGFX = \", add "pkg/data/tmapa008.dat \" down where pkg/data/tmapa007.dat etc are.

then below, add a new line under the others like so:
pkg/data/tmapa008.dat: gfx/textures-32/filelist_tmapa008.txt pkg/data/palette.dat $(PNGTORAW) $(RNC)

Run "make pkg-enginegfx" game compile command
copy compiled "keeperfx\pkg\data\tmapa008.dat" to KeeperFX data folder
change level .inf byte to 08 via hex editor






(You can also replace the graphics in one of the original folders 0-7, make sure you have a filelist_tmapaXXX.txt as well).

There is talk of making a batch file in the future for packing custom graphics.

If that doesn't work:

The tools it tries to run are 32bit, so Trotim has compiled 64bit versions (these are png2bestpal.7z and pngpal2raw.7z). Extract and place them in the tools folder, then rerun!

----------------------------------
what pkg-gfx does, is call a few other make commands, including one that does the campaigns, and the one you need, the pkg-enginegfx
that gives you the correct files, and skips all the campaigns and more stuff you don't need
